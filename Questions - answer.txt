What design patterns did you use inside the application?
 - I use Vanilla PHP for the application

What libraries did you use?
 - I did not use library

Why did you use this library?

Are there other libraries available?

If yes, what made you choose this library over the others?

What major challenges did you encounter when making the app?
-Time. 48 hours is a enough time to create the application including the UI, but I'm currently in a situation wherein I was able to make the system for only a few hours.

If you had more time, what additional features would you like to add?
Probably use an MVC pattern for it and improve the UI of the application.
